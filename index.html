<h1><b> ABOUT </b></h1>
<div class = "About">
    <p>
    I am super passionate about the intersection of 
    biology and technology, specifically bioinformatics 
    and biotechnology. My past research projects in 
    high school involved creating artificial knee 
    cartilage in the wet lab, as well as using AI 
    tools to build machine learning models that track 
    COVID-19 strains. Click on the Projects tab to learn
    more!

    I’m looking to continue this line of research through my college career and beyond. Outside of my academic interests, I’ve been professionally singing for ten years and also love playing badminton!
